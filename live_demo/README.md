# Live Demo

## Install Dependencies

First of all, make sure you are in the [live_demo](./live_demo) directory, then install all the necessary modules with

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If on Mac, make sure you are using python 3 as default or use pip3 instead
If on Mac M1, make sure you are using a proper environment with Metal.

## Run and Access

Once you have installed all the required modules, you can run the server with

```console
python -m main
```

A window will then open allowing you to choose your framerate (for 2 to 10).
